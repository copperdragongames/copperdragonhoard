Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it.

All kalkes act with the arrogance of magi while having the social characteristics of baboons. Being of fiendish blood, kalkes do not age and require neither food nor drink. Though lacking any formal spellcasting ability, all kalkes can produce magical effects through the dramatic mumming of largely spontaneous and unstudied rituals.<br><strong>Hoard Magical Paraphernalia.</strong> The drive to produce ever more fanciful rituals gives a kalke the compulsion to accumulate spell components, magical foci, and other occult paraphernalia. Although these objects serve no purpose, the kalkes seek out spellcasters in their vicinity and steal any paraphernalia they can find. Because they have no ability to distinguish what’s magically useful from what isn’t, they grab any jewelry, pouches, sticks, or ornate objects they uncover. Sometimes children, animals, or other small humanoids are taken to be used as sacrifices, if they can be easily carried away.<br><strong>Perform Rituals.</strong> Troops of kalkes inhabit trees, caverns, and ruins around sites of significant magical activity. Twice a month, or more during major astrological and seasonal events, the kalkes gather to perform—by way of dance, chant, and sacrifice—an imagined rite of great magic. The effort has an equal chance of achieving nothing whatsoever, causing dangerous but short-lived misfortunes (snakes raining on the countryside, creatures summoned from the lower planes), or triggering calamities (great fires or floods).<br>An additional side effect of these rituals is that the troop may gain or lose members magically. If the troop numbers less than 13, a new kalke appears as if from nowhere; if it contains 13 or more members, then 3d4 of them find themselves mysteriously gated to the nearest location of magical activity—often hundreds of miles away. Those teleported arrive in a state of hysteria, with individuals extinguishing flames, grabbing frippery, and running in all directions. Because kalkes have no control over their displacement, it’s not surprising to find them in abandoned dungeons or keeps, clutching the property of some long-lost wizard.<br><strong>Hagglers.</strong> The kalkes will return the goods they've taken, in exchange for a ransom or fee. These exchanges need to have the outward appearance of being impressively in the kalke’s favor. A particularly generous (or devious) spellcaster may be able to reach an accommodation with a persistent local troop of kalkes.<br>Content licensed under the

If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can't be held or carried by an unwilling creature.<br>The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully.

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.</table><br><em><strong>On Target.</strong></em> You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.</table><br><em><strong>Off Target.</strong></em> You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 x 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</table><br><em><strong>Similar Area.</strong></em> You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</table><br><em><strong>Mishap.</strong></em> The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"action","cost":"1","condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":"Instantaneous"},"target":{"value":10,"width":null,"units":"ft","type":"cube"},"range":{"value":10,"long":null,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":1,"max":1,"per":"day"},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"util","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[["3d10","force"]],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"level":7,"school":"con","components":{"value":"","vocal":true,"somatic":false,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"innate","prepared":true},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/spells/runes-magenta-3.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"0000000000000019","name":"Natural Armor","type":"equipment","data":{"description":{"value":"","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attuned":false,"attunement":0,"equipped":true,"rarity":"","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"armor":{"value":16,"type":"natural","dex":null},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"speed":{"value":null,"conditions":""},"strength":0,"stealth":false,"proficient":true},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}],"effects":[]}

Their scaly skin and keen night vision as well as their dextrous claws and sensitive snouts make them quick to sense danger, and their clawed feet move them out of danger with cowardly speed. They are small but fierce when fighting on their own terms, and their weight of numbers helps them survive in places where larger but less numerous races can’t sustain a settlement. Kobolds are great miners, good gearsmiths, and modest alchemists, and they have a curiosity about the world that frequently gets them into trouble.<br><em><strong>Underworld Merchants.</strong></em> Kobolds are merchants to both the surface world and the world beneath it, with their greatest cities hidden deep below the earth. Their enemies are the diabolical gnomes, the dwarves, and any other mining races that seek dominance of dark, rich territories.<br>Kobolds are closely allied with and related to dragonborn, drakes, and dragons. The kobold kings (and there are oh‑so‑many kobold kings, since no kobold ruler is satisfied with being merely a chieftain) admire dragons as the greatest sources of wisdom, power, and proper behavior.<br><em>This kobold is bedecked in satchels, pouches, sacks, and bandoliers. All of these are bursting with tools, bits of scrap, wire, cogs and twine. Impossibly large eyes blink through the lenses of its goggles.</em><br>Some kobolds hatch a bit cleverer than their counterparts. These sharp-witted creatures feel driven to fiddle with the world, and those that don’t meet an early demise through accident or violence often take up tinkering. Trapsmiths make a kobold lair into a deadly gauntlet of hidden pain.<br><em><strong>Shifting Peril.</strong></em> Trapsmiths aren’t warriors; they avoid direct confrontation with enemies that aren’t mired in traps or engaged with other foes. If the trapsmith senses that invaders in its lair are likely to get past its traps, it tries to hide or escape.<br>A trapsmith delights in laying traps and snares behind invaders, along tunnels and paths they’ve already cleared and believe to be safe, then luring them back through its handiwork.<br>Content licensed under the @Compendium[koboldpressogl.koboldpressmonsters.KPOGL]{Open Game

The beast's yellow, waxy scales darken with age, though lantern drakes rarely live more than 50 years or so. They weigh from 5 to 10 pounds and are 18 inches long. Most believe they are the result of an arcane fusion of a radiant spirit with a paper drake.<br><strong>Eat Candle Wax.</strong> The drake devours four ounces of candle wax per day, plus four more ounces if it uses its belly lantern. A lantern dragonette’s unusual diet leads it to lair in libraries, abbeys, and other places of study. Even though the dragonettes eat candles essential for study during dark hours, they still provide light and protect their adopted homes. Residents and caretakers consider them good luck and enjoy conversing with them.<br><strong>Telepathic Chatterbox.</strong> This gregarious drake prefers to speak with its companions but uses telepathy if necessary, and the creature hisses when surprised or displeased. It loves nothing more than discussing magic and history with an intelligent and informed individual.<br><strong>Adventurous Companions.</strong> Occasionally, a dragonette wishing to learn more about the world finds a spellcaster or adventuring party to travel with, purely for the sake of learning or to acquire new sources of knowledge. Most parties enjoy the traveling light source and the abilities these companions bring to bear. A lantern dragonette avoids combat and uses its abilities only to escape or to defend its lair, family, and friends.<br>A dragonette lives up to 30 years. A mated pair produces one clutch of two to five eggs every five years, and one parent raises the young dragonettes until they mature after a year and leave to search for their own lairs. A cloister of lantern dragonettes taxes their lair’s resources, so the other parent often ventures out to retrieve more candles.<br>Content licensed under the @Compendium[koboldpressogl.koboldpressmonsters.KPOGL]{Open Game License}","public":""},"alignment":"lawful neutral","race":"","type":"dragon","environment":"","cr":0.5,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":100},"source":"ToB"},"traits":{"size":"tiny","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["paralyzed","unconscious"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","draconic","elvish","custom"],"custom":"Primordial; telepathy 60 ft."},"senses":"darkvision 60 ft."},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":1,"prof":0,"total":1,"passive":11},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"prof":0,"total":1,"passive":11},"arc":{"value":1,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":3,"prof":2,"total":5,"passive":15},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"prof":0,"total":-2,"passive":8},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":1,"prof":0,"total":1,"passive":11},"his":{"value":1,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":3,"prof":2,"total":5,"passive":15},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"prof":0,"total":1,"passive":11},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":1,"prof":0,"total":1,"passive":11},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":3,"prof":0,"total":3,"passive":13},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"prof":0,"total":1,"passive":11},"nat":{"value":1,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":3,"prof":2,"total":5,"passive":15},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"prof":2,"total":3,"passive":13},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":1,"prof":0,"total":1,"passive":11},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":1,"prof":0,"total":1,"passive":11},"rel":{"value":1,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":3,"prof":2,"total":5,"passive":15},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":1,"prof":0,"total":1,"passive":11},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":1,"prof":0,"total":1,"passive":11},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"prof":0,"total":1,"passive":11}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":"","rwak":"","msak":"","rsak":"","abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"Roll20%20Assets/Tokens/Tome%20of%20Beasts/581902-Lantern_Dragonette.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Lantern Dragonette","displayName":20,"img":"Roll20%20Assets/Tokens/Tome%20of%20Beasts/581902-Lantern_Dragonette.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":60,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"LSunBhaTdo4GDLhX","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"0000000000000001","name":"Lantern Belly","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>If the dragonette has eaten 8 ounces of candle wax in the last 24 hours, it can emit a continual flame for 3d20 minutes.

Their scaly skin and keen night vision as well as their dextrous claws and sensitive snouts make them quick to sense danger, and their clawed feet move them out of danger with cowardly speed. They are small but fierce when fighting on their own terms, and their weight of numbers helps them survive in places where larger but less numerous races can’t sustain a settlement. Kobolds are great miners, good gearsmiths, and modest alchemists, and they have a curiosity about the world that frequently gets them into trouble.<br><em><strong>Underworld Merchants.</strong></em> Kobolds are merchants to both the surface world and the world beneath it, with their greatest cities hidden deep below the earth. Their enemies are the diabolical gnomes, the dwarves, and any other mining races that seek dominance of dark, rich territories.<br>Kobolds are closely allied with and related to dragonborn, drakes, and dragons. The kobold kings (and there are oh‑so‑many kobold kings, since no kobold ruler is satisfied with being merely a chieftain) admire dragons as the greatest sources of wisdom, power, and proper behavior.<br><em>This small, draconic humanoid struts as though it were ten feet tall. It wears the gilded skull of a small dragon as a helmet, and its beady eyes gleam out through the skull’s sockets. It hefts its spear and shield and lets out a blood-curdling shriek, signaling the attack.</em><br>While most kobolds are scuttling scavengers or pathetic sycophants, a few carry a spark of draconic nobility that can’t be ignored. These few forge their tribes into forces to be reckoned with, rising to the rank of chieftain. A kobold chieftain stands proud, clad in war gear of fine quality and good repair. Their weapons are tended by the tribe’s trapsmiths, particularly evident in their springspike shields.<br><em><strong>Living Legend.</strong></em> A kobold chieftain is more than a leader, it is a symbol of the tribe’s greatness. The strongest, most cunning, most ruthless of a kobold tribe embodies their connection to the revered dragons.

It serves as a familiar, protective spirit to nearby farmsteads or villages, so long as tribute is regularly paid to the haugbui. Traditional offerings may include pouring the first beer from a barrel, leaving portions of meals out overnight, sacrificing blood or livestock, or burying a portion of any income in the mound.

When new, a living wick looks and moves like a human, but as the wick burns, the wax features melt and the statue takes on a twisted, hunchbacked appearance.<br><strong>Short-Lived as a Candle.</strong> Living wicks are powered by flames, and therefore they have a predetermined life cycle. They are typically reduced to formless lumps in a month, but some say a living wick’s affordability more than makes up for its inevitable obsolescence. Individuals looking to quickly construct a building or fortification without the expense of paid labor or the questionable ethics of necromancy find living wicks obedient and efficient, as do those needing an army for a single battle.<br>Living wicks are active only when their wicks are lit, and only respond to the telepathic commands of whoever lit them. This makes it easy to transfer living wicks between owners, even those not well-versed in the use of magic.<br><strong>Explosive Ends.</strong> The amount of magical energy contained within a living wick, paired with the manner in which it is released, gives them a remarkable capability for selfdestruction. If their controller demands it, all living wicks can release the magic contained within their form all at once, engulfing themselves and anyone nearby in flames. This can make storing them a gamble, but many see it as an asset, especially those seeking to destroy evidence or anonymously attack their enemies.<br><strong>Constructed Nature.</strong> A living wick doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br>Content licensed under the @Compendium[koboldpressogl.koboldpressmonsters.KPOGL]{Open Game License}","public":""},"alignment":"unaligned","race":"","type":"construct","environment":"","cr":0.25,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"ToB"},"traits":{"size":"sm","di":{"value":["poison","psychic"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":["fire"],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["blinded","charmed","deafened","exhaustion","frightened","paralyzed","petrified","poisoned","unconscious"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["custom"],"custom":"shares a telepathic link with the individual that lit its wick"},"senses":"sight 20 ft.

Hating and fearing all strangers, they live in open plains and scrubland.</em><br><strong>Nomadic Families.</strong> Loxodas live in small herds of 2-3 extended families. Several of these communities will usually cluster together, allowing members to move between groups as they get older. They have no permanent settlements, and instead loxoda families travel to new areas when they deplete the available food. Voracious eaters, a family of loxodas will quickly strip trees bare of leaves, or hunt and cook an entire elephant. They devour both meat and vegetation.<br><strong>Often Underestimated.</strong> Many people assume that loxodas are as dull witted as the ogres they resemble. This is often a fatal mistake, as the elephant centaurs are quite intelligent. Their simple equipment and straightforward living comes not from a lack of skill or knowledge, but their own isolationism and xenophobia. Their immense size and quadruped body makes it difficult for them to mine metal ore, and they violently reject communications and trade with other people. The little metal they can gather is either taken from the bodies of their prey or stolen in raids on dwarven, human, or gnoll settlements.<br><strong>Vestigial Tusks.</strong> All loxodas have curved tusks. While they are too small for use in even ritual combat, they are often decorated with intricate carvings, inlays or dyed in a pattern developed by their family. Each individual also adapts the patterns with their own individual marks, often inspired by important events in their lives. Some loxodas put golden rings or jewelled bracelets stolen from humanoids onto their tusks as trophies—a loxoda matriarch may have long dangling chains of such ornaments, indicating her high status and long life. They stand 18 feet tall and weigh nearly 20,000 pounds.<br>Content licensed under the @Compendium[koboldpressogl.koboldpressmonsters.KPOGL]{Open Game License}","public":""},"alignment":"neutral evil","race":"","type":"monstrosity","environment":"","cr":6,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":2300},"source":"ToB"},"traits":{"size":"huge","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["custom"],"custom":"Loxodan"},"senses":""},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":1,"prof":0,"total":1,"passive":11},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"prof":0,"total":2,"passive":12},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":1,"prof":0,"total":1,"passive":11},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":4,"prof":0,"total":4,"passive":14},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":1,"prof":0,"total":1,"passive":11},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"prof":0,"total":2,"passive":12},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":1,"prof":0,"total":1,"passive":11},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"prof":0,"total":2,"passive":12},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":1,"prof":0,"total":1,"passive":11},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"prof":0,"total":2,"passive":12},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":1,"prof":0,"total":1,"passive":11},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":1,"prof":0,"total":1,"passive":11},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":1,"prof":0,"total":1,"passive":11},"sur":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"prof":3,"total":5,"passive":15}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":null,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":null,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":null,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":null,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":null,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":null,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":null,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":null,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":null,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":"","rwak":"","msak":"","rsak":"","abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"Roll20%20Assets/Tokens/Tome%20of%20Beasts/581925-Loxoda.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Loxoda","displayName":20,"img":"Roll20%20Assets/Tokens/Tome%20of%20Beasts/581925-Loxoda.png","tint":"","width":3,"height":3,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"WcCJlYGtY0q7ETwr","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"0000000000000001","name":"Trampling Charge","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>If the loxoda moves at least 20 feet straight toward a Large or smaller creature it then attacks with a stomp, the stomp attack is made with advantage.

Some jaculi may feign docility or even pretend to be friendly and helpful, but wise travelers know that the creatures drop such ruses as soon as they can steal what they’re really after.<br>Content

The creatures often forge alliances and work together for mutual benefit, while making their unnerving mark on communal lairs.<br>Dust goblins range from 2 to 4 feet tall, and weigh between 20 and 80 pounds.<br>Content licensed under the @Compendium[koboldpressogl.koboldpressmonsters.KPOGL]{Open Game License}","public":""},"alignment":"neutral evil","race":"goblinoid","type":"humanoid","environment":"","cr":0.25,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"ToB,MS"},"traits":{"size":"sm","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["charmed","frightened"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","goblin"],"custom":""},"senses":"darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 9"},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":3,"prof":0,"total":3,"passive":13},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"prof":0,"total":-1,"passive":9},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"prof":0,"total":-1,"passive":9},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"prof":0,"total":-1,"passive":9},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"prof":0,"total":-1,"passive":9},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"prof":0,"total":-1,"passive":9},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"prof":0,"total":-1,"passive":9},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"prof":0,"total":-1,"passive":9},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"prof":0,"total":-1,"passive":9},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"prof":0,"total":-1,"passive":9},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":3,"prof":0,"total":3,"passive":13},"ste":{"value":1,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":3,"prof":2,"total":5,"passive":15},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"prof":0,"total":-1,"passive":9}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":null,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":null,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":null,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":null,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":null,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":null,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":null,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":null,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":null,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":"","rwak":"","msak":"","rsak":"","abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"Roll20%20Assets/Tokens/Tome%20of%20Beasts/581821-Goblin_Dust.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Dust Goblin","displayName":20,"img":"Roll20%20Assets/Tokens/Tome%20of%20Beasts/581821-Goblin_Dust.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":60,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"je7Q1ioDwm0SM2dA","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"0000000000000001","name":"Twisted","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>When the dust goblin attacks a creature from hiding, its target must make a successful DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or be @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.pAcHCDJBhybiVzMF]{frightened} until the end of its next turn.","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":null,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":"","long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"save","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":"","value":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"wis","dc":10,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"sort":1,"flags":{},"img":"icons/mystery-man.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"0000000000000002","name":"Shortsword","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

Despite their great physical and intellectual power, dragons are always suspicious of any creature willing to work for them. The first hoard golem was created when a dragon realized that there could be no guardian more trustworthy with its hoard than the hoard itself. Since then, the secret of hoard golem construction has emerged, and rich nobles have followed suit, enchanting their wealth to defend itself from thieves.<br><strong>Patient Homebodies.</strong> As constructs, hoard golems are mindless, lying in wait for anyone other than their creator to come within striking distance. In the case of evil dragons, this may include the wyrmlings of dragon parents looking to establish dominance in the family. Hoard golems fight to the death, but they rarely leave the rooms they inhabit for fear that clever treasure hunters might trick the hoard into walking itself right out of the owner’s den.<br><strong>Silent and Wealthy.</strong> Hoard golems cannot speak. A hoard golem is 25 feet tall and weighs 20,000 lb.

Some are descendants of Boreas or the Snow Queen (a few having both parents), but they are also born to frost giants and thursir. A few result from tearful pleas by pregnant women lost in the snows, desperate to keep their newborn child from freezing to death—the fraughashar carry these infants away and raise them as ice maidens.<br><strong>Solitary Lives.</strong> Most ice maidens live solitary existences save for a servant or two under their thrall. They’re lonely creatures, desperate for love but condemned to know companionship only through their magical kiss. If genuine love ever fills an ice maiden’s heart, she’ll melt into nothingness.<br><strong>Killing Dilemma.</strong> An ice maiden’s hunger for affection and human contact leads them to harm those they approach, which only drives them harder to seek for warmth, love, and approval.

It wrecks seaside communities with battering winds and carves coastlines with its powerful magic. Though not very intelligent, it singles out a community and tries to lure residents into the waves with its animal messenger ability, sending gulls bearing confused riddles, grand promises, and eerie noises to the townsfolk.<br><strong>Ocean Sacrifices.</strong> When coastal villagers suffered from a hurricane or tsunami, they fell back on folklore and blamed the stirrings of the dreaded isonade. To some, appeasing a leviathan such as this makes sense. Some say that a degenerate group seeks to draw the beast forth by sailing from sight of land and dumping a long chain of bound and screaming sacrifices into the lightless depths of the sea.<br><strong>Enormous Age and Size.</strong> The isonade is more than 45 feet long. The beast’s age is unknown, and many coastal bards tell some version of the legend—some believe it is the last of its kind, others believe that a small group of isonade remains.<br>Content licensed
