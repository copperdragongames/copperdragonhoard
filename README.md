Copper Dragon's Hoard

This is a collection of homebrew options for D&D 5e, ready to be added to your D&D 5e games on Foundry Virtual Tabletop. The content available in this addon can also be found on DriveThruRPG, and my patrons on Patreon get access to a much more detailed version of this addon.

To be fair, it's not really a hoard yet, but it's growing. Each time I publish on DriveThruRPG, I'll be adding a portion of the content to this addon, and adding as much as I can to the Patreon-exclusive version. 

In these initial stages, Copper Dragon's Hoard is just a collection of homebrew magic items, but as I learn more about addon development for Foundry, I plan to add additional features - scenes, NPCs, rollable tables, and more.

Enjoy looting the hoard!
