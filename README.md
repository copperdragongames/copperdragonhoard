Copper Dragon's Hoard

This is a collection of homebrew options for D&D 5e, ready to be added to your D&D 5e games on Foundry Virtual Tabletop. The content available in this addon can also be found on DriveThruRPG.

To be fair, it's not really a hoard yet, but it's growing. Each time I publish on DriveThruRPG, I'll be adding a portion of the content to this addon.

At this point, Copper Dragon's Hoard consists of the following: a collection of homebrew magic items for 5E, a handful of maps with walls and lighting, and more on the way!

For more information, including links to my Patreon, YouTube channel, Twitch channel, and DriveThruRPG products, visit www.copperdragongames.com.

Enjoy looting the hoard!
